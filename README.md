# Equity Portfolio Management

Constructed and managed a 10-stock equity portfolio benchmarked against the S&P 500. Includes investment policy statement, beta-weighted allocation, sector attribution analysis, and risk-adjusted performance evaluation.

## Overview

This project was completed as part of **FINA 8663: Investment Analysis** at Northeastern University (Fall 2025). The team selected 10 large-cap U.S. equities, built a diversified portfolio with a value-oriented strategy, and evaluated performance over a 3-month holding period (September–November 2025).

| MSFT | Microsoft | Technology | 6.00% | 0.96 |
| TTE | TotalEnergies | Energy | 10.00% | 0.71 |
| PG | Procter & Gamble | Consumer Staples | 11.00% | 0.54 |

**Portfolio Beta: 0.56**

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Portfolio | Benchmark (S&P 500) |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| Holding Period Return | -0.50% | 1.08% |
| Standard Deviation | 0.64% | 0.82% |
| Sharpe Ratio | -0.07 | -0.049 |
| Treynor Ratio | -0.0008 | -0.0004 |
| Jensen's Alpha | 0.00% | N/A |

## Methodology

- **Investment Policy Statement (IPS):** Defined objectives, risk tolerance, constraints, and a 20-year investment horizon
- **Asset Allocation:** Beta-weighted approach favoring defensive sectors (68% in Consumer Staples, Healthcare, FMCG)
- **Attribution Analysis:** Decomposed returns into allocation effect (+0.04%) and selection effect (-1.31%)
- **Risk Analysis:** Calculated Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, Jensen's Alpha, and portfolio variance

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (portfolio construction, beta calculations, performance tracking)
- Yahoo Finance (market data)
- Bloomberg
- S&P Global (benchmark data)

## Files

- `Portfolio_Management_Excel.xlsx` — Portfolio framework with holdings, returns, and risk calculations

## My Contribution

Built the initial Excel portfolio framework and coordinated project integration, managing timeline adherence and quality assurance across all deliverables.

## Key Takeaways

- Defensive beta positioning (0.56) reduced portfolio volatility but limited upside capture during the holding period
- Allocation decisions were slightly positive (+0.04%), while stock selection detracted (-1.31%) driven primarily by Novo Nordisk's clinical trial setbacks
- The portfolio performed in line with risk-adjusted expectations (Jensen's Alpha ≈ 0%), validating the defensive strategy even in a challenging environment
